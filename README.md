# SlingshotDungeon
Is our entry for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2018" target="_blank"> 2018 GameMaker's ToolKit Game Jam</a> where the theme was about "GENRE without MECHANIC."\
To protect the assets created by my fellow team members, I have only included the scripts used to create this game.

## Description
In Sligshot Dungeon you play as a man who has escaped from his captors but is not free yet as he must climb his way of the dungeon and into his freedom.

Slingshot Dungeon takes the platforming genre, removes the jumpin mechanic, and replaces with a "Slingshot" effect that launches you as well,
as other items and obstacles, into the air creating fun an interesting platforming and puzzles to solve.
